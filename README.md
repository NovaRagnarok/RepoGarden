# RepoGarden

RepoGarden is a local-first pixel habitat where your repositories become tiny deterministic invader creatures.

The product is intentionally not dashboard-first. The default experience is a living scene that helps you notice projects, recover context, and resume with a small next move.

## Local-first 0.9 release candidate

RepoGarden 0.9 is a local-first CLI release candidate. The habitat-first loop, local storage location, and reset behavior are ready for real users, while individual views and optional provider integrations may continue to evolve before v1.

RepoGarden:

- scans only the roots you configure
- stores app state under `~/.repogarden`
- never modifies your git repositories
- leaves repository updates to your normal git workflow outside RepoGarden
- may read branch names, commit subjects, dirty file names, and small diff previews for display in the habitat
- can be reset with `rm -rf ~/.repogarden`

The Claude/Codex usage bar is opt-in. If enabled in Settings, it reads local provider CLI credentials to call those providers' usage endpoints directly. Details: [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Install

```bash
npm install -g @outsideheaven/repogarden
repogarden
```

## Preview

Each repo becomes a tiny pixel creature whose look reflects branch state, recency, and dirty files. Pick one and press `↵` to drop into a per-repo workbench. (Regenerate the recording with `vhs tape/demo.tape` — see [`tape/README.md`](tape/README.md).)

## First 5 minutes

After `npm install -g @outsideheaven/repogarden`:

1. Run `repogarden`.
2. When asked, give it a folder that contains git repos — e.g. `~/repos` or `~/code`. Multiple paths work too (comma- or newline-separated).
3. The garden fills with one creature per repo. Use `↑` / `↓` to move between them.
4. Press `g` to cycle Garden → Rooms → Journal → GitHub. The first three are
   local-repo views; the optional GitHub catalog is available when enabled in
   Settings.
5. Press `↵` on a creature to drop into its workbench (portrait, notes, recent commits).
6. Press `?` for the full keymap, `s` for settings, `q` to quit.

If anything looks off, `rm -rf ~/.repogarden` resets local state. If you enabled the provider usage bar, `REPOGARDEN_DISABLE_USAGE=1 repogarden` suppresses it for one run.

## Requirements

- Node 22+
- `git` on `PATH`
- a terminal at least 80×24

End users install the published CLI with `npm install -g @outsideheaven/repogarden` (see top of README). For local development the repo uses **pnpm** (pinned via `packageManager` in `package.json`); the easiest way to get the right pnpm version is via [Corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html), which ships with Node.

## Quick start (from source)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NovaRagnarok/RepoGarden.git
cd RepoGarden
corepack enable
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

That runs the Ink-based terminal UI: scan, garden/rooms/journal views, the optional GitHub catalog, per-repo workbench, mouse + keyboard. `pnpm install` runs the `prepare` script automatically (which builds `dist/`), so `node dist/cli.js` and the `repogarden` bin work right after install.

## Product guardrails

- The habitat is the product.
- The workbench is a utility room, not the main surface.
- If the home screen starts reading like a dashboard, the work is drifting.

## Privacy

RepoGarden is local-first. No repository contents are sent to any RepoGarden-operated server.

Ordinary startup does not contact npm or another service to check for updates.

RepoGarden stores local app data under `~/.repogarden`, including configured roots, project notes, blockers, event logs, repo paths, commit subjects, and branch/vibe snapshots.

During normal operation the app reads repo paths, branch names, commit subjects and authors, dirty file names, and small diff previews for display in the habitat.

GitHub discovery is optional and off by default. If enabled in Settings, RepoGarden uses your existing `gh` CLI login to fetch repository metadata directly from `api.github.com`, matches it to local repos by `origin`, and shows unmatched GitHub repos in a catalog where you can explicitly clone one into a configured local root.

User-written notes, blockers, and journal content may contain private information. RepoGarden keeps that data local unless you explicitly copy or share it elsewhere.

### Local data layout

The `~/.repogarden` layout is the supported local storage location for the 0.9 line. Future releases may add files, rename fields, or migrate records, and should keep 0.9 installs readable or migrate them forward without manual edits where practical. If local state ever gets into a bad shape, deleting `~/.repogarden` remains the supported reset path; it never deletes or modifies the git repositories themselves.

- `tui.json` — app settings, scan roots, theme, view, and feature toggles
- `projects/<repo-id>.json` — small per-repo memory such as hidden state, last visit, blocker mirror, and garden placement
- `projects/<repo-id>/notes.json` — per-repo note index
- `projects/<repo-id>/notes/*.md` — note bodies
- `events.jsonl` — append-only journal event log
- `events.meta.json` — journal seed/backfill marker
- `scan-snapshot.json` — last known vibe, mood, branch, and head per repo
- `scan-cache.json` — cached scan details for faster startup
- `github-repos.json` — optional cached GitHub repo metadata when GitHub discovery is enabled

### Reset local data

All local app state lives under `~/.repogarden`. To wipe it and start fresh:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.repogarden
```

The next launch will re-run onboarding and rebuild the journal/snapshot from a clean slate. RepoGarden never modifies your git repos themselves — this only clears the app's own files.

### Claude / Codex usage bar

The Claude/Codex usage bar is off by default. Turn it on from Settings (`s`) with `u`.

When the bar is enabled and any ready view or the workbench renders, RepoGarden attempts to read local Claude Code and Codex CLI OAuth credentials, refreshes tokens if needed, and calls the providers' usage endpoints directly. Refreshed tokens may be written back to the same local file or macOS Keychain entry used by those CLIs.

RepoGarden does not send these credentials to any RepoGarden-operated server. The credentials are used only to call the originating provider.

The implementation lives in:

- `src/lib/usage.ts`
- `src/hooks/use-usage.ts`

The endpoints used here are not documented public APIs and may change.

To enable or disable the usage bar persistently, open Settings (`s`) and press `u` — the toggle is saved to `~/.repogarden/tui.json`.

For a single run without changing the saved setting:

```bash
# installed package
REPOGARDEN_DISABLE_USAGE=1 repogarden

# from source
REPOGARDEN_DISABLE_USAGE=1 pnpm dev
```

The env var takes precedence; either path suppresses the network call entirely.

### Reduced motion

The garden tween, dither cross-fade, creature wander, blink, spinner, skeleton, and the boot scene all respect a reduced-motion setting. Open Settings (`s`) and press `m` to toggle it persistently, or set `REPOGARDEN_REDUCED_MOTION=1` / `NO_MOTION=1` (or `CI=true`) for a single run:

```bash
REPOGARDEN_REDUCED_MOTION=1 repogarden
```
